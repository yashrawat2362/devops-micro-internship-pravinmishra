# Assignment 2 — ReplicaSets: Keeping Your Pods Alive

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will create an NGINX ReplicaSet, verify it maintains three Pods, test its auto-healing behavior by deleting a Pod, and scale it from three to five replicas.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Your Working Directory

## Goal

Create the `~/k8s-labs/replicasets` working directory.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `~/k8s-labs/replicasets` working directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create and Apply the ReplicaSet

## Goal

Write `nginx-replicaset.yaml` (apiVersion `apps/v1`, kind `ReplicaSet`, 3 replicas, `selector.matchLabels` matching `template.metadata.labels` as `app: nginx`, image `nginx:1.21.1`), apply it, and confirm three Pods are created.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `nginx-replicaset.yaml` and terminal output showing three running Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Test ReplicaSet Auto-Healing

## Goal

Delete one Pod managed by `nginx-replicaset` and confirm Kubernetes creates a replacement, restoring the desired count of three.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing the deleted Pod and the newly created replacement, with the desired count remaining three

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Scale and Inspect the ReplicaSet

## Goal

Change `replicas` from 3 to 5, reapply the manifest, and confirm five Pods are managed, then inspect the ReplicaSet with `describe` and `get pods -o wide`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing five Pods and the `nginx-replicaset` details

Add your screenshot here.

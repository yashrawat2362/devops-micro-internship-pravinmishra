# Assignment 1 — Creating Your First Pod in Kubernetes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will create an NGINX Pod first imperatively with `kubectl run`, then declaratively with a YAML manifest, and practice inspecting, logging into, and executing commands inside the Pod.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Your Lab Folder

## Goal

Create the `~/k8s-labs/pods` working directory for all Pod-related files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `~/k8s-labs/pods` working directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create a Pod Imperatively

## Goal

Create `nginx-pod` with `kubectl run --image=nginx`, verify it reaches Running, then delete it so the name can be reused by the YAML manifest.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing `nginx-pod` in Running state before deletion

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Pod Declaratively

## Goal

Write `nginx-pod.yaml` (apiVersion `v1`, kind `Pod`, label `app: nginx`, container `nginx-container` using image `nginx`, port 80), apply it, and confirm it reaches Running.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `nginx-pod.yaml` and terminal output showing `nginx-pod` in Running state

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Inspect and Access the Pod

## Goal

Run `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, and `kubectl exec -it ... -- /bin/bash` to inspect the Pod and browse `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, or the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory

Add your screenshot here.

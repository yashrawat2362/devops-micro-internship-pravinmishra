# Assignment 11 — AI-Assisted Kubernetes Incident Triage

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that checks the health of the Book Review App running on your Kubernetes cluster, connect it to Claude Code as a reusable `/k8s-triage` skill, then deliberately break your own deployment, use the skill to diagnose the failure from evidence alone, recover it yourself, and verify the fix. This closes out the AI Assignment series with the same discipline applied at every layer so far — a single Linux host, two clouds, Terraform, Ansible, a CI/CD pipeline, a Docker image, and now an orchestrated Kubernetes cluster: gather evidence with a read-only tool, let AI analyze it and recommend a fix, keep a human in charge of every action that changes the cluster, and verify again.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm the Healthy Baseline and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm every Book Review App pod is `Running` and `Ready` and that its Service has active Endpoints, then set up a workspace folder for this assignment before writing any automation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get endpoints` showing the Book Review App healthy

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Workspace folder structure for this assignment

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 2 — Add Safety Rules to CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Add a `CLAUDE.md` telling Claude this is a read-only Kubernetes triage workflow: it must never run `kubectl apply`, `delete`, `rollout restart`, `edit`, or `scale` on its own, and every recovery action must be reviewed and run by you.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `CLAUDE.md` showing the project overview, incident workflow, and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan the Triage Checks

## Goal

Ask Claude to propose a read-only, five-check `kubectl` triage plan — pod status, pod readiness, restart counts, recent namespace events, and Service endpoints — before you write any script.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Claude's proposed five-check plan, with no file created or cluster state changed

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Build the Kubernetes Triage Script

## Goal

Write a Bash script that runs the five read-only `kubectl` checks and writes a PASS/WARN/FAIL report with an overall status and exit code.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Script showing the five checks and how each one gathers its evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — `bash -n` and `ls -l` confirming the script is valid and executable

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Run the Script Against the Healthy Cluster

## Goal

Run the script against your current, unmodified deployment and confirm it reports a clean, healthy baseline before you simulate anything.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Script output showing all five checks passing

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Build and Run the /k8s-triage Skill

## Goal

Wrap the script in a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools (no `Write`), and confirm `/k8s-triage` reports the healthy baseline using the script's evidence without touching the cluster.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing the tool restrictions and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — `/k8s-triage` output for the healthy cluster

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Simulate an Incident and Let the Skill Diagnose It

## Goal

Deliberately break your own deployment — an image tag that does not exist, or a misconfigured readiness probe — then run `/k8s-triage` and confirm it correctly identifies the failure, quotes the evidence, and recommends a fix without applying it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — The pod in a failed state and the Service showing no Endpoints

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — `/k8s-triage` output showing the diagnosis and the recommended `kubectl` command, not executed by Claude

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — Recover, Verify, and Summarize

## Goal

Review the recommendation, apply the fix yourself, confirm the pod returns to `Running`/`Ready` with active Endpoints, run `/k8s-triage` again to verify, and write a short incident summary.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Pod back to `Running`/`Ready` and the Service showing Endpoints again

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Second `/k8s-triage` run confirming recovery

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Compare this incident to the Nginx incident from Week 3's AI-Assisted Linux Health Check. What stayed the same about the process, and what changed about the evidence you had to gather?

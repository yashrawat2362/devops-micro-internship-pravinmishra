# Assignment 9 — Kubernetes Services (LoadBalancer)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will provision a small AKS cluster, deploy probed NGINX Pods, expose them with a public LoadBalancer Service, test the internet endpoint, and observe readiness and scaling.

---

# Task 1 — Provision and Connect to AKS

## Goal

Create resource group `rg-aks-lb-lab` and a one-node AKS cluster `aks-lb-lab` (`westeurope`, `Standard_B2s`), then fetch credentials and verify the node.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — AKS creation result and Ready node output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Deploy the Probed NGINX Workload

## Goal

Create two healthy, probed NGINX Pods for the public Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Successful rollout and two Ready Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create and Test the LoadBalancer Service

## Goal

Create `nginx-svc-lb` (type `LoadBalancer`, port 80), wait for `EXTERNAL-IP`, and test it with `curl`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Service with public `EXTERNAL-IP` and successful `curl` output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Prove Readiness Affects Public Traffic

## Goal

Apply a broken readiness patch, confirm the Pod leaves the endpoint set and public availability is affected, then restore health.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Endpoint changes and public `curl` behavior before and after recovery

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Scale Behind the Stable Public Endpoint

## Goal

Scale to four replicas and confirm the endpoint set grows while the public IP stays the same.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Four replicas/endpoints behind the unchanged public endpoint

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Troubleshoot and Clean Up

## Goal

Resolve any pending endpoint or unhealthy backend issues, then delete the Kubernetes objects and Azure resource group when finished.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Clean final verification or resource deletion command output

Add your screenshot here.

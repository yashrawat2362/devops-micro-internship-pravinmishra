# Assignment 4 — Auto-Scaling & Auto-Healing: Let Kubernetes React for You

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will prove Deployment auto-healing by deleting a Pod, then configure a CPU-based Horizontal Pod Autoscaler that maintains between two and five NGINX Pods.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up the Lab Directory

## Goal

Create the `~/k8s-labs/autoscaling` working directory.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `autoscaling` directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Prove Deployment Auto-Healing

## Goal

Create `demo-autohealing` (two replicas), delete one Pod, and confirm the desired count of two is restored automatically.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Deleted Pod and replacement Pod with the replica count restored

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create the HPA-Ready Deployment and Enable Metrics

## Goal

Deploy `nginx-deployment` with CPU `requests: 100m` / `limits: 200m`, then enable Metrics Server (Minikube addon or manifest + kubelet TLS patch for kind) and confirm it reports `READY 1/1`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Deployment resources plus successful Metrics Server status

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Create and Inspect the HPA

## Goal

Create an HPA (imperatively via `kubectl autoscale` or declaratively via `autoscaling/v2`) targeting `nginx-deployment` with min 2, max 5, and 50% target CPU utilization.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — `kubectl get hpa` and `kubectl describe hpa nginx-hpa` output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Optionally Generate CPU Load

## Goal

Generate CPU load inside an NGINX Pod (`yes > /dev/null`) and monitor whether the HPA increases replicas.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — HPA output showing current metrics and any replica increase

Add your screenshot here.

# Assignment 2 — Ad-Hoc Automation on Azure: 4 VMs, Inventory & Passwordless SSH

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision four Azure Linux VMs with Terraform, configure passwordless SSH, build a custom Ansible inventory with web/app/db groups, and run ad-hoc commands across individual hosts and groups.

---

# Task 1 — Provision 4 Azure VMs (Terraform)

## Goal

Provision four Ubuntu 22.04 VMs (`web1`, `web2`, `app1`, `db1`, Standard_B1s) with SSH key authentication and public IPs, in a VNet with an NSG allowing SSH (22) and HTTP (80), and output all four public IPs.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing successful `terraform apply` output and `terraform output public_ips`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Azure Portal showing all four running Ubuntu VMs

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Network Security Group inbound rules showing SSH 22 and HTTP 80

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Configure Passwordless SSH

## Goal

Connect to each of the four VMs as `azureuser` and run `hostname` remotely without a password prompt.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing successful `hostname` output from all four passwordless SSH tests

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Custom Ansible Inventory

## Goal

Create `inventory.ini` mapping VM indices 0–1 to `[web]`, index 2 to `[app]`, and index 3 to `[db]`, with `ansible_user` and `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` set under `[all:vars]`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Editor or terminal showing `inventory.ini` with the web, app, db, and all:vars sections

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Run Your First Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands

## Goal

Run `ping`, `whoami`, and `uptime` against all hosts; install and start Nginx on the `web` group with `--become`; install `htop` on all hosts; and run `df -h` on `db` and `free -m` on all hosts.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing `ansible ping` SUCCESS for all four hosts

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing `uptime` output for all four hosts

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing Nginx installation and service start on the web group

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing `htop` installation on all hosts and group-targeted command output

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Describe an issue you faced and how you fixed it, what you learned, when you'd use an ad-hoc command instead of a playbook, and one challenge you faced during SSH or inventory setup.

Write your answer here.

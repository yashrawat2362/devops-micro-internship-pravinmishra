# Assignment 4 — Deploy Mini Finance Project Using Terraform and Ansible

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision an Azure VM with Terraform and use Ansible to automate the install, deploy, and verify workflow for the Mini Finance static website — a clean separation between infrastructure and configuration management.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Folder Layout

## Goal

Create the `mini-finance` project with separate `terraform/` and `ansible/` subdirectories.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal or editor showing the complete `mini-finance` project tree

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Terraform — Azure VM + NSG (Ports 22/80)

## Goal

Provision an Ubuntu 22.04 Standard_B1s VM with a public IP, SSH key authentication, and an NSG allowing SSH (22) and HTTP (80), and output the public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing the end of a successful `terraform apply`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing `terraform output public_ip`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform code or Azure Portal showing NSG inbound rules for ports 22 and 80

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Configure Passwordless SSH

## Goal

Connect to the VM with SSH using the injected key and run `hostname` remotely without a password prompt.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Terminal showing the successful passwordless SSH hostname check

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Ansible — Multi-Play: Install → Deploy → Verify

## Goal

Create `ansible/inventory.ini` and a three-play `site.yml` that installs Nginx and Git, clones and deploys the Mini Finance repository to `/var/www/html/` with a reload handler, and verifies HTTP 200 from `localhost`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Editor showing `inventory.ini` and the three plays in `site.yml`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml` with HTTP 200, assertion OK, and no failures

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Test End-to-End Functionality

## Goal

Confirm the Mini Finance site is publicly accessible and correctly served by Nginx.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Browser showing the Mini Finance site loaded from `http://<public_ip>` with the URL visible

Add your screenshot here.

## Goal

Publish a LinkedIn post about the Terraform + Ansible deployment, mentioning the Azure VM, secure networking, passwordless SSH, Nginx deployment, and HTTP verification, with one challenge you faced and how you fixed it, and one real-world example of this workflow.

## Evidence

# Assignment 3 — Design a Three-Tier Network with Load Balancer on Azure

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will design and deploy a three-tier network architecture on Azure using a Virtual Network, subnets, a Virtual Machine, NGINX, and a Public Load Balancer. The web, application, and database tiers are separated into dedicated subnets, and a Public Load Balancer provides the application entry point.

---

# Task 1 — Create a Virtual Network with Three Subnets

## Goal

Create `eb-demo-vnet` (10.0.0.0/16) with `web-subnet` (10.0.1.0/24), `app-subnet` (10.0.2.0/25), and `db-subnet` (10.0.3.0/26), inside Resource Group `vnet-demo-rg`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Subnet configuration screen showing the three subnets and Bastion subnet (if enabled)

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Deploy the Web VM and Install NGINX

## Goal

Create Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM `web-nginx` in `web-subnet` with a public IP and inbound SSH (22) and HTTP (80), then install and start NGINX and verify the default page via the VM's public IP.

> No screenshot required for this task. Completion is verified through Task 4.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Public Load Balancer

## Goal

Create Standard Public Load Balancer `web-public-elb` with frontend IP `web-elb-ip`, backend pool `web-backend-pool` (containing `web-nginx`), a TCP port-80 health probe `web-health-probe`, and load-balancing rule `web-http-rule`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Load Balancer frontend IP configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Test the Architecture

## Goal

Confirm the NGINX default page is reachable through the Load Balancer's public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Browser showing the NGINX welcome page through the Load Balancer Public IP

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Clean Up Resources

## Goal

After capturing all required evidence, delete the `vnet-demo-rg` Resource Group to avoid ongoing charges.

> No screenshot required for this task.

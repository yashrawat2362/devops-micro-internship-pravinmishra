# Assignment 5 — AI-Assisted CI/CD Pipeline Failure Triage

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that fetches the latest run of your dual-pipeline EpicBook project (Azure DevOps and/or GitHub Actions) and categorizes any failure it finds — dependency, build, test, authentication, or agent/runner availability. You will then connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/pipeline-triage` skill, deliberately break your pipeline in a safe and obvious way, use the skill to diagnose the break from evidence alone, fix it yourself, and verify recovery with a second run of the skill.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm the Healthy Baseline and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm the latest run on both Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions currently succeeds, then create the workspace folders for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Latest run status on Azure DevOps and/or GitHub Actions showing a successful run

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Define the Read-Only Workflow in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create `CLAUDE.md` describing the pipeline-triage workflow (gather → analyze → human applies the fix → verify) and the safety rules: never re-trigger, retry, cancel, or approve a pipeline run; never modify pipeline YAML; never read or print a secret, token, or service connection credential.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` showing the workflow and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Build the Pipeline Triage Script

## Goal

Build `pipeline-triage.sh`, a read-only Bash script that fetches the latest run's status/log using `az pipelines runs list`/`az pipelines runs show` and/or `gh run list`/`gh run view --log-failed`, and classifies any failure it finds into one of five categories using pattern matching against the log evidence. The script must only ever read run status and logs — it must never trigger, retry, cancel, or approve a run.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `pipeline-triage.sh` showing the check functions and their pattern-matching conditionals

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Run the Script Against the Healthy Pipeline

## Goal

Run the script against your current, passing pipeline and confirm it produces a clean report with no failure detected.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Script output and report showing a healthy result with no failure category triggered

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Build and Run the /pipeline-triage Skill

## Goal

Create a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools (no `Write`) that runs the script, reads the report, and explains the result with evidence — and confirm it correctly reports the healthy baseline without re-running, cancelling, or modifying anything.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing the tool restrictions and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — `/pipeline-triage` output for the healthy pipeline

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Deliberately Break the Pipeline and Diagnose It

## Goal

Introduce one safe, obvious, and easily reversible failure (for example, an intentionally wrong test assertion or a typo'd dependency name), push it so the pipeline fails, then run `/pipeline-triage` and confirm it correctly names the failure category, quotes the exact log evidence, and recommends a specific fix — without taking any action itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — The failed pipeline run showing the red/failed status

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — `/pipeline-triage` output showing the diagnosed failure category, the quoted log evidence, and the recommended fix

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Fix, Push, and Verify Recovery

## Goal

Apply the recommended fix yourself, push it, confirm the pipeline succeeds again on both providers, and re-run `/pipeline-triage` to confirm it now reports a healthy result.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — The pipeline run succeeding after your fix

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Second `/pipeline-triage` output confirming the pipeline is healthy again

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Explain, in your own words, why the skill was allowed to gather evidence and diagnose the failure but was never allowed to re-trigger the pipeline or apply the fix itself.

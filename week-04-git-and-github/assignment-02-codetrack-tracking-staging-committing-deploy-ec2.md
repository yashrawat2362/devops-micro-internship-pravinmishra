# Assignment 2 — CodeTrack: Tracking, Staging, Committing + Deploy to EC2

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will track and stage project files, create two meaningful Git commits in `CodeTrack`, verify your commit history, and deploy the CodeTrack static website to an EC2 instance using Nginx. This connects local version-control practice with a basic manual deployment workflow used in real DevOps environments.

# Task 2 — Create index.html and style.css

## Goal

Create the two starter UI files inside `CodeTrack`.

### Evidence

# Task 5 — Create the First Commit (Clean Initial Commit)

# Task 6 — Modify index.html and Create a Second Commit

## Goal

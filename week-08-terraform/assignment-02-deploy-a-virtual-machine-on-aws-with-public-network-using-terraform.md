# Assignment 2 — Deploy a Virtual Machine on AWS with Public Network Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to create a custom AWS network (VPC, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, route table) and launch an EC2 instance into the public subnet with a public IP, a Security Group allowing SSH and HTTP, and Nginx installed for validation.

---

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project

## Goal

Create a `terraform-aws-vm` project directory for the AWS Terraform configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — File Explorer, VS Code, or terminal showing the `terraform-aws-vm` project directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create main.tf with the Required AWS Resources

## Goal

Define the AWS provider, a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) and private subnet (10.0.2.0/24), an Internet Gateway with public routing, a Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), an EC2 instance in the public subnet with a public IP, and a public IP output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 (optional) — `main.tf` showing the VPC and EC2 resource blocks

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Run `terraform init` and confirm the working directory initializes successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing successful `terraform init` output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply`, and record the EC2 instance's public IP from the Terraform output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform apply output showing successful completion

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Terraform output showing the EC2 public IP

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Verify the Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the EC2 instance is running in the public subnet with a public IP, install Nginx, and confirm it is accessible by browser or SSH.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — EC2 instance running in the AWS Console, with the subnet and public IP visible

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Browser showing the Nginx page through the EC2 public IP, or terminal showing a successful SSH connection

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Destroy Resources

## Goal

Run `terraform destroy` to remove the Terraform-managed AWS resources after testing.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing successful `terraform destroy` completion

Add your screenshot here.

---

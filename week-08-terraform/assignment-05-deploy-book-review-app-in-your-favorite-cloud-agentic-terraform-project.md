# Assignment 5 — Deploy Book Review App in Your Favorite Cloud (Agentic Terraform Project)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the Terraform section. You will deploy the Book Review App in a production-style three-tier architecture using Terraform on your choice of AWS or Azure — six subnets across two Availability Zones, tier-specific security rules, public and internal load balancers, Next.js/Node.js on Ubuntu VMs, and a private managed MySQL database with a read replica. This assignment is agent-assisted: you may use Claude Code, ChatGPT, or another LLM tool to help design, generate, debug, and improve the infrastructure.

# Task 1 — VPC/VNet and Subnet Setup

## Goal

Create a custom VPC/VNet (10.0.0.0/16) with six subnets across two Availability Zones: two public Web Tier subnets, two private App Tier subnets, and two private Database Tier subnets, implemented with Terraform.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VPC or VNet details showing 10.0.0.0/16

Add your screenshot here.

#### Screenshot 2 — Subnet list showing all six subnets, their tiers, CIDR ranges, and Availability Zones

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Terraform plan or cloud networking view showing the required routing and tier isolation

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 2 — Security Groups/NSGs and Load Balancers

## Goal

Configure tier-specific Security Groups/NSGs (Web Tier HTTP 80, App Tier 3001 only from Web Tier, Database Tier 3306 only from App Tier), and create a public load balancer for the frontend and an internal load balancer for the backend, all with Terraform.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Web, App, and Database Security Group or NSG rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Public frontend load balancer configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Internal backend load balancer configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Healthy frontend and backend targets or backend pools

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 3 — VMs and Application Deployment

## Goal

Deploy the Next.js Web Tier behind Nginx on port 80 in the public subnets, and the Node.js App Tier on port 3001 in the private subnets (no Elastic IPs/Public IPs on private VMs), with the frontend reaching the backend through the internal load balancer.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — EC2 or Azure VM dashboard showing the frontend and backend VMs

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Nginx status or frontend response on the Web Tier

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Backend API response through the permitted internal path

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 4 — MySQL Database Setup

## Goal

Deploy a private managed MySQL database (Amazon RDS Multi-AZ or Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server) with a read replica, restricted to the App Tier on port 3306, and validate the Book Review App homepage, login, review flow, backend API, and database integration through the public load balancer.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Amazon RDS or Azure Database dashboard showing the primary database and read replica

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Evidence of private database networking and permitted App Tier access

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Functional Book Review App homepage and login flow

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Functional review flow with working backend API and database integration

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 (optional) — Application logs or terminal output

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Report the cloud platform used (AWS or Azure), your Terraform code structure (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and supporting files), a link/description of your architecture diagram, and the Public Load Balancer DNS used to access the frontend.

Write your answer here.

# Assignment 7 — AI-Assisted Docker Container Hardening Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits a running Docker container for common hardening gaps — running as root, missing health checks, unpinned image tags, privileged mode, and unnecessary exposed ports — then connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/docker-audit` skill. You will run the audit against your production-grade EpicBook stack, fix what it finds by editing the Dockerfile yourself, rebuild the image, and re-run the audit to prove the fix worked. Claude analyzes evidence and recommends a fix; it never edits your Dockerfile or rebuilds the image itself.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm the Running Stack and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm your production-grade EpicBook containers from this week's capstone are currently running, note the exact name of your application container, and set up a project workspace for the audit.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `docker ps` showing your running EpicBook application container

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create Project Context and Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create a `CLAUDE.md` in your workspace that tells Claude this project only ever gathers container evidence and recommends a Dockerfile fix — it must never run `docker build`, `docker rm`, `docker stop`, `docker rmi`, or edit the Dockerfile itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` open in VS Code showing the project overview, hardening workflow, and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan Before Writing the Script

## Goal

Ask Claude Code to inspect your running container using only read-only Docker commands and propose a six-check hardening audit plan, without creating or editing any file.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Claude's proposed audit plan and read-only inspection

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Build the Docker Hardening Audit Script

## Goal

Write a Bash script that runs `docker inspect` and `docker image inspect` against your target container and checks: the container exists, whether it runs as root, whether a `HEALTHCHECK` is defined, whether the image tag is pinned instead of `:latest`, whether the container runs in privileged mode, and how many ports it exposes. The script must be strictly read-only and must produce a report file with a clear pass/warning/failure summary.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Your audit script open in an editor, showing the six check functions

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Terminal output of `bash -n` confirming the script has no syntax errors, and `ls -l` showing it is executable

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Run the Audit Against Your Current Container

## Goal

Run the script against your running EpicBook container and record the results honestly, even if one or more checks fail — most first-time containers fail at least one (commonly: no `USER` directive, no `HEALTHCHECK`, or a `:latest` tag).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Script output showing your Full Name and all six check results

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /docker-audit Skill

## Goal

Turn the script into a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools, and run `/docker-audit` to confirm Claude reads the report, explains each finding with evidence, and recommends a specific Dockerfile fix — without modifying anything itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing the tool restrictions and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — `/docker-audit` output showing the findings and Claude's recommended fix

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Fix the Findings, Rebuild, and Verify

## Goal

Edit your Dockerfile to apply Claude's recommendation, rebuild the image, recreate the container, and re-run `/docker-audit` to prove the previously failing check now passes.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Your edited Dockerfile line(s) showing the fix

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — `docker build` and `docker run` succeeding with the rebuilt image

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Second `/docker-audit` run showing the previously failed check now passing

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

In one paragraph, explain why the `/docker-audit` skill is allowed to gather evidence and recommend a Dockerfile fix, but is never allowed to edit the Dockerfile or rebuild the image itself.

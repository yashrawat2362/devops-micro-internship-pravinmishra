# Assignment 6 — Safety Rails for Your AI Agent

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will configure safety and control mechanisms for Claude Code using permissions and hooks. You will define team-level command restrictions and implement prompt-level and tool-level hooks to prevent destructive actions before they execute.

# Task 1 — Create Claude Code Configuration Structure

## Goal

Create the `.claude` directory structure required for team-level Claude Code configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `.claude` folder structure visible in VS Code Explorer

---

# Task 2 — Create the UserPromptSubmit Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that checks user prompts before Claude processes them and blocks requests containing destructive intent.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `user-prompt-guard.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

---

# Task 3 — Create the PreToolUse Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that runs before Claude executes Bash commands and blocks dangerous infrastructure commands.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `pre-tool-guard.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

![pre-tool-guard.sh](./screenshots/ss6.3.png)

---

# Task 4 — Create the PostToolUse Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that runs after Claude executes a Bash command and logs selected Terraform commands.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — `post-tool-logger.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

---

# Task 5 — Configure settings.json to Connect Hook Scripts

## Goal

Configure Claude Code permissions and connect the hook scripts created in the previous tasks.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `settings.json` open in VS Code showing permissions and hooks configuration

![settings.json](./screenshots/ss6.5.1.png)

---

# Task 6 — Test the UserPromptSubmit Hook

## Goal

Prove the prompt-level hook works by typing a destructive prompt and verifying it is blocked before Claude processes the request.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — UserPromptSubmit hook blocking the destructive prompt

![prompt-level hook](./screenshots/ss6.6.png)

---

# Task 7 — Test the PreToolUse Hook

## Goal

Prove the tool-level hook works by asking Claude to execute a dangerous Bash command.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — PreToolUse hook blocking terraform destroy

![tool-level hook](./screenshots/ss6.7.png)

---

# Task 8 — Test the PostToolUse Logging Hook

## Goal

Prove the logging hook runs after a successful command execution and records Terraform operations.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Claude running terraform validate successfully

![logging hook](./screenshots/ss6.8.png)

#### Screenshot 9 — `.claude/deploy.log` showing the logged command

Not Created `.claude/deploy.log` file
